TODOs:

Add client side validation using a bootstrap or jQuery plugin.
Add additional server side validation.
Add a salt and hash password.
Improve the basic schema by adding display name support, geolocation, and timestamps to posts.
Port to Zend Framework or Code Igniter. MVC is easier to read / organize. 
Pagination on posts.
AJAXify updates instead of page refresh.
Create RESTful API.
Move common styles from login / register to external css.
Minify everything.
Move config out.

Recommendations:

Tell candidate to have a LAMP stack up and running.
Provide a private repository to commit to.
The Zend dmg takes a while to download if it ever does.
